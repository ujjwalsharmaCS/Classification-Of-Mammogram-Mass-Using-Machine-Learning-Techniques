Classification Of Mammogram Mass Using Machine Learning Techniques


This project is to predict whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant.
I have used several Machine Learning Techniques, namely

  1. DECISION TREES
  2. RANDOM FORESTS
  3. K-MEANS AND KNN
  4. SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE
  5. NAIVE BAYES
  6. ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK

The aim of this project is to compare different Machine Learning Algorithms.
